# Analysis with KNN and Logistic Regression

## Description

This project implements and compares **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and
**Logistic Regression** models applied to different datasets.\
The main goal is to explore the performance of both algorithms in
classification tasks, using healthcare and engineering (O-Ring failures)
datasets.

## Project Structure

-   `AssignmentKNN2_Logistic.ipynb`: 
    - Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis, model training, and results.
    - Includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
    - Outputs include plots, statistical test results, and insights.
-   `AssignmentKNN2_Logistic.html`: HTML export of the notebook, to be
    viewed without running the code.
-   `healthcareTrain.csv`: Training dataset containing healthcare-related data.
-   `healthcareTest.csv`: Test dataset for model validation.
-   `ORing.csv`: Additional dataset about O-Ring failures.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need: - Python 3.x\
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab\
- Libraries:\
`bash   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`

## Execution

1.  Clone or download this repository.\
2.  Open the file `AssignmentKNN2_Logistic.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.\
3.  Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis.

## Results Overview

The analysis provides key insights such as:

-   Relationships among healthcare metrics and patient outcomes.
-   Predictive modeling performance on healthcare data.
-   Influencing factors for O-Ring performance and reliability.
